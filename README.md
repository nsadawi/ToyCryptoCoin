# ToyCryptoCoin

Hello every one
- Here I show how to implement a simple blockchain and crypto currency using Python.
- The implementation goes through stages. In the beginning we create a very simple blockchain, then in part 2 we add add `proof of work` and in part 3 we add `mining rewards and transactions`. In part 4 we add `signing of transactions` to make our currency more secure.
- My implementation is based on this nice tutorial (which uses javascript):
